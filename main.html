                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>I'm a passionate traveler and an aspiring coder, driven to merge my love for exploration with a career in web development. I’m particularly drawn to web development because of the flexibility and variety it offers, allowing me to work with diverse teams and organizations as I seek a role where I can truly feel at home.
                    <br>
                    Currently, I’m building a solid foundation in web development through Codecademy, and this website is a showcase of my growing skills in the field. Here, you'll find both current and upcoming projects that reflect my journey in tech—just scroll down to explore!
                    <br>
                    Beyond coding and travel, I'm an avid reader, climber, and photographer, always seeking the next adventure. My travels wouldn’t be complete without sampling local street food and savoring hot drinks from each destination, which have become essentials in my life on the road. You can also find a curated selection of travel photos on this website.</p>
